# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
## Introduction
This repository is for my projects in the Tech Academy's HTML & CSS Course, which is part of the curriculum for the Cybersecurity Course.  Included below are several key projects that incorporate much of what has been learned so far.  While I've gotten a lot out of all of the courses taught so far, this one stands out as a favorite!

## Projects
[Space Station Project:](https://github.com/traverstefan/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Academy%20Cinemas%20Project) This project incorporates         HTML and CSS to create a website for a space travel agency.

[Academy Cinemas Project:](https://github.com/traverstefan/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Academy%20Cinemas%20Project) This project is a website       for a movie theater.  It was styled using Bootstrap 4, and includes features such as a NavBar, Jumbotron, and Form Cards.

[Portfolio Website:](https://github.com/traverstefan/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Portfolio%20Website%20Project) This project features many of       the HTML and CSS concepts learned during the course, and is meant to provide a basic showcase of the skills I've picked up along the way.
